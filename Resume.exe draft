üîê Safety First


Your Vision: A Safe, Interactive Resume Executable
You could build a lightweight, cross-platform application (like a Python-based executable or web app) that:

Showcases real demos: Genealogy problem-solving simulations, ancestry data parsing, DNA triangulation workflows.

Runs technical samples: Blueprint interpretation examples, document generation from templates, or even live data filtering.

Integrates project management: Simulated issue tracking, team dashboards, version control logs.

Uses real or dummy databases: Interactive ancestry trees, vehicle diagnostics, or academic records.

Includes an ‚ÄúAbout Me‚Äù CLI or GUI: That walks through your experience like a skill tree or narrative.

You could structure it like a menu system:

Package it with safety in mind:

No network access or write permissions to prevent abuse.

Sandboxed execution.

Exportable logs/screenshots so others can ‚Äúsee‚Äù your simulated skills without running it live if needed.

Would you like help building this as a simple prototype in Python or turning it into a sleek web-based version with interactive panels? I can even help generate examples that simulate problems and show how you'd solve them‚Äîlike a choose-your-own-adventure powered by your skills.
